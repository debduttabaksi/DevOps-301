# Python App - CICD, Listen to port 9090, Dockerizing -38080

Create CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application Deployment.

Building a Python Application in Jenkins
Python application which is a command line tool "add2vals" that outputs the addition of two values. 
values is a string, "add2vals" treats both values as a string and instead concatenates the values. The "add2" function in the "calc" library (which"add2vals" imports) is accompanied by a set of unit tests. These are tested with pytest to check that this function works as expected and the results are savedto a JUnit XML report.
